/* About Glitch:
Glitch is a WP theme with a lot of style work. While I could've used something like Bootstrap or Foundation, for my own personal work, I prefer to avoid using frameworks. I like having complete control; I have no deadlines or budget restrictions, and I generally have a very specific idea of how things should lay out that don't always fit into a traditional framework.

Hopefully I didn't miss anything this time around. */
