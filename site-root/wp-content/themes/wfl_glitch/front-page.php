		<p>Identity is simple, yet complex. In this context, we are talking about personal identity. Self. A definition of self is, in social context, a way to verbally summarize your own perception (or the perception others have) of you, distilled into a simple, understandable role.</p>

		<p>The problem with such an identity is that you lose detail; like compressing a jpeg, the more you compress an identity, the more distortion becomes prominent. We are more than a sentence or two, but we still try to express a personal identity into something that would fit into Twitter’s original character limit.</p>

		<p>Great sense of humor. Good with their hands. Easily angered. These short descriptors do us favors in some cases, while harming us in others.</p>

		<p>My own personal identity is chaotic. I could attempt to craft a clear definition of myself, but even then, the identity presented is colored by my own perception of self, leaving details out that otherwise might be important.</p>

		<p>In the past, I would’ve said I’m a creative and technical person, blending the two into everything I do in life.</p>

		<p>The problem with that is the detail is lost; all the details of me, such as my difficulty with social cues, necessitating a focused study in human interaction. My obsession with order, and bringing chaos towards it, yet revelling in the complexity of chaos. My focus on rationality, and my inability to comfortably interact with those who are unable, or unwilling to do the same.</p>

		<p>John Milton, the author of Paradise Lost, wrote some of the most detailed prose I have ever read. The imagery crafted within his words is, in my opinion, some of the most descriptive writing I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. Even with all that detail, however, is the compression of translation to words.</p>

		<p>Milton himself has a complex identity that many have tried to qualify; Woman-hater. Man of God. Poet. Long-winded. I myself hate Milton as a man, but still appreciate his words. I think I appreciate his prose because, even though the struggle for truth in identity is impractical, his approach is among the closest to crafting soemthing preceivable as "real" in the fictionalized imagery.</p>

		<p>So, I continually work to hone my identity on the web. Now, I share the code behind the identity. A digital instruction set for who I am; the question is, will you perceive each facet? Do you analyze the structure of my code for clues, or take the rendered output at face value? Do you perceive the 3 pillars as significant in some way? If so, what IS the significance of each?</p>

		<p>With luck, you will take this as a statement to the complexity, and fallibility, in sharing yours or someone elses’ identity as you perceive it.</p>

		<p>No problem; just use the navigation icon in the upper right to access the menu, and you can start browsing to your heart’s content my art, photography, videos, music, blogs and more.</p>

		<p>Alternatively, you can hate me and my work and tell me just how much by contacting me. I love hate mail, and if you’re the right (or wrong) kind of lucky, I may share it for my readers in my blog or a video.</p>
